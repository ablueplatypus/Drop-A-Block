### Tetris App!

Building out a Tetris Application for a Flatiron School final project.

##Daily Goals
Day 1 & 2: Would like to convert app to React maybe use Redux the pieces falling down on a page and stopping when they reach the bottom of the world.

Day 3: Have random pieces falling from the top of the page and pieces move left to right.

Day 4: The game ends when frozen pieces reach the top of the page.

Day 5 & 6: Find a way to have a full row clear without adversely affecting the world.

Day 7: Starting to connect backend.

##Reality
 Day 1: Research and figuring out how to set up redux. Trying to understand first steps to convert vanilla Tetris Demo to React.
 Would like to start by rendering the world on the page.

##How to run app
 npm install
 npm start
