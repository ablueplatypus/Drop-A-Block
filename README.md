### Tetris App!

Building out a Tetris Application for a Flatiron School final project. This application was inspired by many very good Tetris games.

Please checkout the following resources:
This app is very well built and looking at the source code helped a bit. https://github.com/chvin/react-tetris/blob/master/README-EN.md

 This is a very good tutorial on building Tetris in vanilla js with canvas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA


##Daily Goals
Day 1 & 2: Would like to convert app to React maybe use Redux the pieces falling down on a page and stopping when they reach the bottom of the world.

Day 3: Have random pieces falling from the top of the page and pieces move left to right.

Day 4: The game ends when frozen pieces reach the top of the page.

Day 5 & 6: Find a way to have a full row clear without adversely affecting the world.

Day 7: Starting to connect backend.

##How to run app  
 npm install  
 npm start
